* Obfuscate the Javascript code, you can use the obfuscator [**here**](https://www.javascriptobfuscator.com/Javascript-Obfuscator.aspx)
* Paste the obfuscated result into the script tag you made
* Create the id property inside of the `<script>` tag you made, and set the id to 'ZeroDivisionErrorHandling'
* Your HTML should look like this now:
  
  ```html
  <script id='ZeroDivisionErrorHandling'>
      // OBFUSCATED CODE HERE
  </script>
  ```
After this, you should be done, and the method should work.
